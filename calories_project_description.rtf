\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 The Calories Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the number of calories burned by individuals based on physical activity and biometric data. \
\
This is particularly useful for fitness tracking and health monitoring. By using features such as age, gender, weight, height, duration of exercise, heart rate, and body temperature, the model can provide personalized calorie burn predictions.\
\
 This project leverages data science to promote better lifestyle choices, support weight management goals, and enhance the functionality of fitness applications.\cb1 \
